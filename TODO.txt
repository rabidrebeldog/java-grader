Features to add:

1.  GUI -
	User selects source dir where project lives
	User selects source dir where student source files are located
	Automatically determine the name of the test runner from the files
	Display individualized student test results

2.  Fault tolerance -
	- Source file doesn't compile : tough to fix but can we remove bad code until it compiles?
	- Student file has infinite loop : kill process after 10 seconds and proceed with rest of tests
